# AO Backend Framework

A comprehensive framework for building decentralized applications on the Arweave/AO ecosystem. This framework provides both server-side and client-side components for building robust and type-safe applications.

## Overview

The AO Backend Framework consists of two main components:

1. **aoxpress**: An [APM](https://apm.betteridea.dev) package for defining handlers with syntax similar to expressjs
2. **aofetch**: An [NPM](#) library for communicating with AO processes from JS/TS
