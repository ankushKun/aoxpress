# aoxpress + aofetch

Framework to define handlers and call them from the frontend using a syntax that's similar to writing and calling express apis

## Overview

The AO Backend Framework consists of two main components:

1. **aoxpress**: An [APM](https://apm.betteridea.dev) package for defining handlers with syntax similar to expressjs
2. **aofetch**: An [NPM](#) library for communicating with AO processes from JS/TS
